1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight? box3
2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`. Block starts a new line and takes up the width of the page.  With inline it does not cause a line break and doesn't span accross the entire page, only what is required by the opening and closing tag.  
3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`? Cross-Axis
4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout? Fixed layout stays the same no-matter what device or screen size you are viewing it on.  With fluid, you build the sight using percentages rather than pixels but when you get onto smaller devices, the material and content can get really narrow.  With adaptive, there are several layouts and when the screen is adjusted, you will see a new layout.  Responsive uses multiple layouts but uses breakpoints so when moving between layout to layout, the content shrinks or grows until it hits the new layout.  
5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outter most container in a responsive website? In order to make sure that the page never goes outside of that width.
